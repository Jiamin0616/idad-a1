        Interfaces: Justine and Limp Body Beat

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This analysis contrasts the interaction design of two creative web
          interfaces:
          <a href="https://tdingsun.github.io/justine/" target="_blank"
            >Justine</a
          >
          by Ding Sun, and
          <a
            href="https://www.adultswim.com/etcetera/limp-body-beat/?s=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,b=240,a=1,c=1"
            target="_blank"
            >Limp Body Beat</a
          >
          by Adult Swim. The evaluation focuses on four aspects of interaction
          design: information design, mapping, characterisation, and feedback.
          While both websites are experimental and heavily sensory-driven, they
          adopt very different strategies in how they engage users and shape
          interaction.

      <section>
        <h2>Information Design</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Justine</strong> mbraces abstraction and poetic expression. It
          doesn’t offer clear instructions or objectives. Instead, it creates a
          mood-driven, sensory atmosphere—one that feels immersive yet elusive.
          Through visual distortion, fragmented text, and non-linear navigation,
          the user is encouraged to wander and interpret freely. Text here
          functions more as emotional texture than informative content.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Limp Body Beat</strong> on the other hand, communicates
          through immediate sensory feedback. It avoids formal instruction but
          quickly teaches users that modifying parameters will trigger
          audiovisual changes. Learning happens through playful interaction
          rather than reading or guidance.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em
            >In summary: <strong>Justine</strong> builds emotional depth through
            ambiguity, while <strong>Limp Body Beat</strong> relies on
            high-energy, sensory feedback to generate excitement.</em

      <section>
        <h2>Mapping</h2>
        <p>
          The interactive logic of <strong>Justine</strong> is intentionally
          ambiguous. Clicking or swiping might trigger unexpected changes—such
          as visual flickers, audio shifts, or even a full reset. This
          unpredictability is central to the project's narrative rhythm, which
          mirrors the non-linear, fragmented nature of memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, <strong>Limp Body Beat</strong>uses a tightly mapped
          system. Users can directly control visual and audio elements by
          adjusting URL parameters. The interface behaves like a chaotic
          soundboard: user inputs are immediately reflected through movement,
          glitches, and tempo changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            ><strong>Justine</strong> disrupts user control to evoke reflection
            and mystery, while <strong>Limp Body Beat</strong> embraces precise
            control to encourage playful, hands-on exploration.</em

      <section>
        <h2>Characterisation</h2>
        <p>
          In <strong>Justine</strong>,the user is cast as a passive
          observer—almost like a ghost drifting through someone else's memory.
          There is no menu, no goal, and no clear instruction. Instead, you
          click and scroll through a poetic landscape, experiencing a story more
          than participating in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <strong>Limp Body Beat</strong>, the user becomes an active
          performer—like a DJ or backstage operator. By tweaking parameters, you
          control the character's movement, music tempo, and visual intensity.
          Every small change leads to dramatic, often absurd results, turning
          the experience into a kind of performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >In a nutshell: Justine turns you into a quiet observer, taking you
            into a sensual dream. And Limp Body Beat turns you into a controller
            of play, pushing you to the center of the stage.</em

      <section>
        <h2>Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          In <strong>Justine</strong>,feedback is subtle and ambient. Clicking
          might result in a flicker, a sound shift, or a slight visual
          transformation—so understated that you may wonder whether anything
          happened at all. This is a deliberate choice: it invites the user to
          slow down and become more attentive to subtle atmospheric changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <strong>Limp Body Beat</strong>, by contrast, reacts loudly and
          instantly. Altering just one parameter can cause the character to
          dance more wildly, the background to distort, or the music to glitch.
          The feedback is exaggerated, fast-paced, and sometimes
          comical—encouraging experimentation and rewarding chaos.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Design motivation: Justine encourages calm thinking by suppressing
            feedback. Limp Body Beat creates the thrill of participation by
            amplifying feedback.</em

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          These two interfaces represent opposite ends of the interaction design
          spectrum.
          <strong>Justine</strong> is slow, contemplative, and poetic—inviting
          introspection and emotional resonance.
          <strong>Limp Body Beat</strong> is fast, chaotic, and absurd—designed
          for fun, reaction, and exploration. Together, they demonstrate how
          interaction design not only shapes behavior, but also deeply
          influences mood, pace, and embodied experience in digital
          environments.
